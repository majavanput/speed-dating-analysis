Question: What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for a female partner?

(1) Least Desirables By Race
(Category: What do you look for in the opposite sex?)
We look at the desirables of both genders by race. In this screenshot, the least desirables of male 
Black/African Americans, European/Caucasian-Americans and Latino/Hispanic Americans is ambitious,
while for female this is shared interests. This is the opposite for other races (male: shared interests,
female: ambitious). Only Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian-Americans male and female have both the same
least desirable attribute (ambitious). So you can generally say the least desirable attributes for a males 
and females differs.

Note: In Speed Dating data set, Native American is among the races. However, no Native American filled in
the Speed Dating questionnaire. Therefore, Native Americans are not shown in the plot.
This is taken care of in the code (not hard coded).

(2) Least Desirables Average
(Category: What do you think MOST of your fellow men/women look for in the opposite sex?)
Male think that the least desirable their fellow women look for in the opposite sex is ambitious.
Female think this is shared interests. There is a difference between both genders in this example.

(3) Least Desirables Percentage
(Category: How do you think you measure up?)
Both male and female think their least desirable is the attractiveness. Both genders have the same 
desirables in this category.

Note: The last two categories in the selectInput ('How do you think you measure up?' and 
'How do you think others perceive you?') have one attribute less than the first three. This is taken care
of in the code.
